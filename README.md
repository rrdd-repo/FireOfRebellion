# Fire of Rebellion

## Description





Fire of Rebellion is a turn-based text adventure game, in which you, as the player, fight through a horde of 10 monsters to save the princess.

You can name your character anything you want, once you do that you start the game by choosing your difficulty level.

Each difficulty level changes the number of potions your character can carry, as shown below:

- **Fácil (Easy)**: 10 potions.
- **Normal**: 6 potions.
- **Díficil (Hard)**: 3 potions.

In the battle screen, how many turns left are shown, as well as your character’s name and HP, likewise the enemy’s stats are shown too.

Below that are 4 main options:

- **Atacar (Fight)**: Attacks the enemy and deals a random amount of damage based on the enemy’s defense value.
- **Cura (Heal)**: Drinks one potion from your backpack and heals the player’s HP. You cannot drink a potion if your health is full or if you don’t have any left.
- **???**: Displays a random quirky message and depending on your luck it’ll either disable the enemy’s defense value (which will make your attacks deal heavier damage) or waste a turn, reminder that the enemy still attacks you.
- **Correr (Run)**: Random chance for the character to run away… Although, in case you’re able to, you’ll basically quit the current run and will be required to restart.

Another important aspect to be aware of is that your runs are saved in a file named “save.sv”. This file will show you the character’s name, the difficulty you’ve chosen, the number of potions you were carrying and how far this character has gotten. Important to note that your progress will not be saved if you quit the game by either closing the game’s window or crashing!
